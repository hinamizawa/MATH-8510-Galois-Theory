# MATH-8510-Galois-Theory

These notes are a mixture from various sources. They are 

* â€ªJames Milne, Field and Galois Theory.
* Patrick Ingram, Lecture Notes.
* Joseph Rotman, Advanced Modern Algebra.
* Keith Conrad, https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/.

For the first several weeks, we follow exactly Patrick's notes with some additional materials from here and there. Then we move on to Milne.
