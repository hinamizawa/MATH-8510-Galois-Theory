\section{Review on polynomial rings}

Let's agree on some facts and conventions from elementary abstract algebra, in particular those with polynomial rings before we dig into Galois theory.

\smallskip

A ring is always commutative with multiplicative identity 1 unless otherwise stated. $R^*$ is the multiplicative group of units in $R$ and $R^\times = R\setminus \{0\}$. We can use these two notations interchangeably when $R$ is a field.

\smallskip

Let $F$ be a field. A polynomial ring $F[X]$ with an indeterminate $X$ is an $F$-vector space with basis $1,X,X^2,\cdots,X^n,\cdots,$ with the multiplication $$(\sum_i a_iX^i)(\sum_j b_j X^j) =  \sum_k (\sum_{i+j=k}a_ib_j)X^k,$$ where $X^0$ is defined to be 1. Alternatively, we can identify $R[X]$ with $$R^{(\NN)}=\{(a_i)_{i\in\NN}: a_i\in R, a_i=0 \mbox{ for all but finitely many }i\in\NN\}$$ in an obvious way. But usually, we want to say $R$ embeds into $R[X]$ although the most formal way is to identify $R$ with a subring of $R[X]$.  We will also use notations like $F[x], k[x]$ and $k[X]$ for polynomial rings as long as there is no confusion.

The degree function has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\deg(f+g) \leq \max(\deg f,\deg g),$
    \item $\deg(fg)=\deg f+\deg g.$
\end{enumerate}

There are plenty results by arguing over the degree of a polynomial. We have $(R[X])^* =  R^*$ if $R$ is an integral domain. We have the division algorithm on $R[X]$.

\begin{thm}
Let $F$ be a commutative ring. Then $F[X]$ is a PID if and only if $F$ is a field.
\end{thm}

Hence or otherwise, $\ZZ[X]$ is not a PID. Indeed, $\langle 2, X\rangle$ is an example of an ideal that cannot be generated by a single polynomial. $K[X,Y]$ is not a PID as $\langle X, Y \rangle$ is not principal.

\begin{thm}
    An ideal in a PID is prime if and only if it is maximal.
\end{thm}

\smallskip

\begin{defn}
    If $f(X)\in F[X]$ where $F$ is a field, then a \emph{root} of $f$ in $F$ is an element $\alpha\in F$ such that $f(\alpha)=0$.
\end{defn}

Given a polynomial $f[X]\in F[X]$ and any $u\in F$, the division algorithm give us: $$f(X)= q(X)(X-u)+f(u).$$

And lying in the center of proving that every finite subgroup of $F^\times$ is cyclic is counting the roots of polynomial $X^n-1$.

\begin{thm}
    Let $F$ be a field and $f[X]\in F[X]$ a polynomial of degree $n$. Then $f$ has at most $n$ roots.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
    Let $F$ be a field. A nonzero polynomial $p(X) \in F[X]$ is said to be \emph{irreducible} over $F$ (or \emph{irreducible} in $F[X]$) if $\deg p \geq 1$ and there is no factorization $p=fg$ in $F[X]$ with $\deg f < \deg p$ and $\deg g < \deg p$.
\end{defn}

A quadratic or cubic polynomial is irreducible in $F[X]$ if and only if it has no root in $F$.

\begin{thm}[Gauss's Lemma]
    A polynomial $f(X)\in \ZZ[X]$ is irreducible if and only if it is irreducible over $\QQ[X]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Eisenstein's Criterion]
    Let $f(X) = a_0+a_1X+\cdots+a_nX^n\in \ZZ[X]$ be a polynomial over integers with $a_n\not= 0$. Suppose that there exists a prime $p$ such that \begin{enumerate}
        \item  $p\nmid a_n$, 
        \item  $p\mid a_i$  for  $i=0,1,\cdots,n-1$,
        \item  $p^2\nmid a_0$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $f(X)$ is irreducible over $\ZZ[X]$.
\end{thm}

A typical application of Eisenstein's Criterion is to prove the irreducibility of the $p$-th cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_p(X) = \frac{X^p-1}{X-1}$, where $p$ is a prime. The idea is to apply the criterion to $\Phi(X+1)$.

\begin{thm}
    Let $F$ be a field and $f(x)$ a polynomial in $F[X]$. Then $(f(X))$ is a prime ideal in $F[X]$ if and only if $f(X)$ is irreducible. Equivalently, $f$ is irreducible if and only if $K[X]/(f)$ is a field.
\end{thm}

\section{Extensions of fields}

Most of this course will involve studying fields relative to certain subfield which we feel we understand better. For example, if $\alpha\in\CC$ is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in $\QQ$, we might wish to study $\QQ(\alpha)$, the smallest subfield of $\CC$ containing $\alpha$ and all of $\QQ$. Certainly, if we want to understand how "complicated" the number $\alpha$ is, it makes sense to consider how "complicated" the field $\QQ(\alpha)$ is as an extension of $\QQ$. If $F \subset E$ are fields, we will denote denote the extension by $E/F$ (this just means that $F$ is a subfield of $E$, and that we're considering $E$ relative to $F$, in particular, $E/F$ is not a quotient or anything too formal). Note that often we will consider $E$ to be an extension of $F$ even if $F\nsubseteq E$, as long as there is an obvious embedding of $F$ into $E$ (an embedding is a homomorphism with is injective). 

We will make a lot of use of the observation that if $E/F$ is an extension
of fields, then we may view $E$ as a vector space over $F$.

\begin{defn}
    Let $E/F$ be an extension of fields. We say that $E$ is a \emph{finite extension} of $F$ if $E$ is finite-dimensional as a vector space over $F$. In this case we denote the dimension by $[E:F]$. We say that $E$ is an \emph{infinite extension} of $F$ if $E$ is infinite-dimensional as a vector space over $F$, and we write $[E:F] = 1$.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}
    $\{1,i\}$ is a basis for $\CC$ as a vector space over $\RR$. So $\CC$ is a finite extension of $\RR$ and $[\CC:\RR]=2$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    It is widely known that $\sqrt{2}\notin\QQ$. Thus $1,\sqrt{2}$ are linearly independent over $\QQ$. On the other hand $(\sqrt{2})^2\in \QQ$ and then any polynomial in $\sqrt{2}$ with rational coefficients is just a $\QQ$-linear combinations of $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$. Since $$\frac{1}{a+b\sqrt{2}} = \frac{a}{a^2-2b^2} +\frac{-b}{a^2-2b^2}\sqrt{2},$$ every rational function of $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as a $\QQ$-linear combinations of $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$. It follows immediately that $\QQ(\sqrt{2})=\QQ[\sqrt{2}]$ and $[\QQ[\sqrt{2}]:\QQ]=2$.  
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We can show $[\CC(x):\CC]=\infty$ by arguing $\{1,x,x^2,\cdots\}$ is a linear independent set.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    To show $[\RR:\QQ]=\infty$, we make use of the unique factorization theorem of integers and argue that $\{\ln(p): p \mbox{ is a prime}\}$ is a linearly independent set.
\end{example}

\begin{thm}
    Let $K\subseteq F\subseteq E$ be fields. Then $E/K$ is a finite extensions if and only if both $F/K$ and $E/F$  are, and when this is the case, we have $$[E:K]=[E:F][F:K].$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
    If $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_j\}$ are bases for $E/F$ and $F/K$ respectively, then $\{a_ib_j\}$ is a basis for $E/K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Consider field extensions $\QQ\subset E= \QQ[\sqrt{2}]\subset F=\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$. We already know $[E:\QQ]=2$ and since $\sqrt{3}\notin E$ and it is a $x^2-3\in E[x]$, we also have $[F:E]=[E[\sqrt{3}:E]=2$. And then $[\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]:\QQ]=4$.
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
    Let $E/F$ be a field extension. An element $\aa\in E$ is \emph{algebraic} over $F$ if there is a non-zero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ such that $f(\aa) = 0$. Otherwise we say that $\aa$ is \emph{transcendental} over $F$. The extension $E/F$ is \emph{algebraic} if every element of $E$ is algebraic over $F$, and is \emph{transcendental} otherwise.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}
    Both $\sqrt{2}$ and $i$ are algebraic over $\QQ$ as they are roots of $x^2-2$ and $x^2+1$.  But $\pi$ and $e$ are transcendental. As you can see, it's much easier to show that something is algebraic over a subfield than to show that it isn't (since to show that it is, one simply needs to exhibit a non-trivial
    polynomial relation). This shows that $\RR/\QQ$ is a transcendental extension, but some more work is required to show that $\QQ(\sqrt{2})$ is algebraic, namely, we need to make sure that the smallest
    field containing $\QQ$ and $\sqrt{2}$ doesn't somehow contain transcendental elements over $\QQ$.
\end{example}


\begin{thm}\label{minimal}
    Let $E/F$ be a finite extension of fields. Then every element of $E$ is algebraic over $F$. Specifically, for every element $\aa\in E$ there is a unique non-zero monic irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ such that $f(\aa) = 0$, and $f(x)$ divides every polynomial $g(x) \in F[x]$ with $g(\aa) = 0$. And this polynomial satisfies $deg(f) \leq [E : F]$. Moreover, if $I=(f)$, then $F[x]/I \cong k(\aa)$; indeed, there exists an isomorphism $\phi: F[x]/I \to k(\aa)$ with $\phi(x+I)=\alpha$ and $\phi(a+I)=a$ for all $a\in F$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $E/F$ is a finite extension and $\aa\in E$. Consider the elements $$1,\aa,\aa^2,\cdots,\aa^{[E:F]}\in E.$$
    Since there are $[E:F]+1$ elements, they must be linearly dependent over $F$. Hence we can find $c_i\in F$ such that $$c_o\cdot 1+c_1\aa+\cdots+c_{[E:F]}\aa^{[E:F]} =0.$$  In other words, $\aa$ is a root of the (non-zero) polynomial $$g(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{[E:F]}c_i x^i \in F[x].$$ And the degree of $g$ is at most $[E:F]$.

    Now consider the evaluation map $$\varphi: F[x]\to E, f(x)\mapsto f(\aa),$$ where one may consider it as the restriction of $e_\aa: E[x]\to E$. Then $\ker(\varphi)$ is non-empty since $g$ lies in it and then $\ker(\varphi)=(f(x))$ for some monic $f(x)\in F[x]$ since $F[x]$ is a PID. Any polynomial $g(x)\in F[x]$ with a root $\aa$ belongs to the kernal and hense is divisible by $f(x)$. Clearly, $\deg f$ is no bigger than $\deg g$ and then no bigger than $[E:F]$. Since $E$ is a field as well, $\im(\varphi)$ is a domain. So the kernel is a prime (hence maximal) ideal and therefore $f$ is irreducible and $\im(\varphi)$ is a field containing $\QQ$ and $\aa$ indeed. $\phi$ is the canonical isomorphism  induced by $\varphi$. 
\end{proof}

Hence, we have $F[\aa]=F(\aa)$ when $\aa$ is algebraic.

\begin{defn}
    The polynomial $f$ constructed in Theorem \ref{minimal} is called the \emph{minimal polynomial} of $\aa$ over $F$.
\end{defn}

In other words, in a finite extension, every element is the root of some polynomial over the smaller field. The next theorem is a partial converse to this, and we will use it often.

\begin{thm}\label{stem}
    Let $k$ be a field and $f[x]$ a monic irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$ of degree $d$. Let $K=k[x]/I$, where $I=(f)$, and $\beta = x+I\in K$. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $K$ is a field and $k'=\{a+I: a\in k\}$ is a subfield of $K$ isomorphic to $k$,
        \item $\beta$ is a root of $f$ in $K$,
        \item if $g(x)\in k[x]$ and $\beta$ is a root of $g$ in $K$, then $f\mid g$ in $k[x]$,
        \item $f$ is the unique monic irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$ having $\beta$ as a root,
        \item $1,\beta,\beta^2,\cdots,\beta^{d-1}$ form a basis of $K$ as a vector space over $k$ and so $\dim_k(K)=d$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    With the knowledge form the warm-up part, we can prove this theorem easily.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  $I$ is a prime ideal hence maximal since $F[x]$ is a PID. So the quotient ring $K=k[x]/I$ is a field. Every field homomorphism is injective and so $k$ embeds into $K$ with its image $k'$.
        \item Let $f(x)= a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_{d-1}x^{d-1}+x^d,$ where $a_i\in k$ for all $i$. In $K=k[x]/I$, we have \begin{align*}
            p(\bb) &= (a_0+I)+(a_1+I)\bb+\cdots+(1+I)\bb^d \\
            &= (a_0+I)+(a_1+I)(x+I)+\cdots+(1+I)(x+I)^d \\
            &= (a_0+I)+(a_1x+I)+\cdots+(x^d +I)\\
            &= a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_{d-1}x^{d-1}+x^d +I \\
            &= f(x)+I = 0+I.
        \end{align*} So $\beta$ is a root of $p$.
        \item If $f\nmid g$ in $k[x]$, then their $\gcd$ is 1 since $f$ is irreducible. Therefore, we can find polynomials $s,t$ in $k[x]$ such that $1=sf+gt$. Treating them as polynomials in $K[x]$ and evaluating at $\beta$, we get $1=0$, a contradiction.
        \item Let $g$ be a monic irreducible polynomial in $k[x]$having $\bb$ as a root. Then by part (3) we have $f\mid g$. Since $g$ is irreducible, we have $g=ch$ for some constant $c$. But both $f,g$ are monic, we have $c=1$ and $f=g$.
        \item Every element of $K$ has the form $g+I$, where $g(x)\in k[x]$. By the division algorithm, we have $g=qf+r$ with either $r=0$ or $\deg(r)<\deg(f)$. Then $g+I=r+I$ since $g-r=qf\in I$. By the calculation similar in part (2), it follows that $r+I = b_0+b_1\bb+\cdots+ b_{d-1} \bb^{d-1}$ if we express $r(x)= b_0+b_1 x+\cdots+b_{d-1}x^{d-1}.$   
        
        If $\{1,\beta,\beta^2,\cdots,\beta^{d-1}\}$ is not linearly independent, then we can find coefficients $c_i\in k$ not all zero such that $$c_0+c_1\bb+\cdots+c_{d-1}\bb^{d-1}=0.$$ Define $g(x)\in k[x]$ by $f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}c_ix^i$. Then $g(\bb)=0$ and $\deg(g)\leq d-1 <\deg(f)=d$. By part (3) says $\deg(f)\leq \deg(g)$ since $f\mid g$. We reach a contradiction.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The pair $(K,\bb)$ is called the \emph{stem field} in Milner.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    The polynomial $x^2+1\in \RR[x]$ is irreducible so $K=\RR[x]/(x^2+1)$ is a finite extension of $\RR$ with degree 2. If $\bb$ is a root of $x^2+1$ in $K$, then $\bb^2=-1$. Moreover, every element of $K$ has a unique expression $a+b\bb,$ where $a,b\in \RR$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let $f(x)= x^4-10x^2+1\in \QQ[X]$. This is an irreducible polynomial: it has no rational roots (if $r/s$ in lowest form was one, then $r\mid 1$ and $r\mid 1$; the only possible rational root was $r/s =\pm 1/1=\pm 1$) and a direct factorization $f(x)=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+c)$ is also impossible. (One can show, however, $f$ is reducible in $\FF_p[x]$ for any prime $p$.) The roots of $f$ are $$\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}.$$
    Let $\bb$ be one of the roots. Consider the field extensions $\QQ\subset\QQ[\bb]\subset \QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$. We already know from pervious example $$[\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]:\QQ]=4=[\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]:\QQ[\bb]][\QQ[\bb]:\QQ].$$ But $\bb$ is a root of irreducible polynomial of degree 4 and therefore $$[\QQ[\bb]:\QQ]=4.$$
    We see that $[\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]:\QQ[\bb]]=1$ and then $$\QQ[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]=\QQ[\bb].$$ 
    And hence all roots of $f$ lies in $\QQ[\bb]$.
\end{example}

\section{Automorphisms}
When one is first introduced to the complex numbers, it is usually as a superset of the reals. We're introduced to $\CC$ as a vector space over $\RR$ with basis $\{1,i\}$ which happens to also admit the structure of a field. One function which helps with the very basic study of $\CC$ from this perspective is the complex conjugation: $$\overline{x+yi}=x-yi$$ for $x,y\in \RR$. The important properties of this function are that it is an automorphism of $\CC$ and that it fixes real numbers (and only real numbers. We would like to identify functions of this form for arbitrary field extensions.

\begin{defn}
    Let $F$ be a field, and let $X \subset F$ be a subset. Then $\varphi: F \to F$ is an automorphism if it is a bijection and a homomorphism, namely, $\varphi(x+y)=\varphi(x)+\varphi(y)$ and $\varphi(xy)=\varphi(x)\varphi(y)$. We denote the group of automorphisms of $F$ by $\Aut(F)$. We say that $\varphi\in \Aut(F)$ fixes $X$ if $\varphi(x) = x$ for all $x \in X$, and we denote the set of automorphisms of $F$ fixing $X$ by $\Aut(F/X)$.
\end{defn}

It's worth noting that this definition of fixing a set is what might more
rightly be referred to as fixing $X$ pointwise. It is sometimes useful to consider functions which fix X setwise, meaning that $\varphi(x) \in X$ for all $x \in X$. Unless otherwise stated, "fix" means "fix pointwise".
Note that, in the lemma below, we make no special assumptions about
the nature of $X \subset F$.

\begin{prop}
    For any field $F$, and any set $X \subset F$, the set $\Aut(F/X)$ is a group under composition.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Just straightforward verifications.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Consider $\Aut(\CC/\RR)$. Every element of $\CC$ can be written as $x+yi$ with $x,y\in\RR$. For any $\sigma\in \Aut(\CC/\RR)$, we must have $\sigma(x+yi)=x+y\sigma(i)$. Furthermore, we also have $$-1=\sigma(-1)=\sigma(i^2)=\sigma(i)^2,$$ and hence $\sigma(i)=\pm i$. So $\Aut(\CC/\RR)$ contains exactly two elements: the trivial one and the complex conjugation. It is clear that $\Aut(\CC/\RR)$ is group --- we need to check the complex conjugation is an automorphism of $\CC$ and twice the complex conjugation is just the identity map.
\end{example}

This example gives us a feeling about how $\Aut(E/F)$ will be for a field extension $E/F$. In general, if $E/F$ is a finite extension with $[E : F] = n$, then we can choose a basis $\aa_1,\cdots,\aa_n\in E$ for $E/F$. Any element of $E$ can be written uniquely in the form $$c_1\aa_1+\cdots+c_n\aa_n,$$ with $c_i\in F$. If $\sigma\in\Aut(E/F)$, then we have $$\sigma(c_1\aa_1+\cdots+c_n\aa_n)=c_1\sigma(\aa_1)+\cdots+c_n\sigma(\aa_n).$$  In other words, the automorphism $\sigma$ is entirely defined by the $n$ values $\sigma(\aa_1),\cdots,\sigma(\aa_n)$. Moreover, if $f_i(x) \in F[x]$ is the minimal polynomial for $\aa_i$, then $$f_i(\sigma(\aa_i)) = \sigma(f_i(\aa_i)) = \sigma(0) = 0.$$
So $\sigma(\aa_i)$ is one of the (finitely many) roots of $f_i$ in $E$. So there are only finitely many possible values for $\sigma(\aa_i)$, for each $i$. We won't count how many automorphisms the can be (this will become easier later), but we've just made the following useful observation:

\begin{thm}
    Let $E/F$ be a finite extension of fields. Then $\Aut(E/F)$ is a finite group. Moreover, if we have $E = F(\aa)$ for some $\aa \in E$, then $\Aut(E/F)$ naturally embeds into the group of permutations of the roots of the minimal polynomial of $\aa$ over $F$.
\end{thm}

Note that $E/F$ does not need to be a finite extension for us to define $\Aut(E/F)$ (indeed, $F$ need not even be a field).
Unfortunately, there are interesting extensions $E/F$ for which the group $\Aut(E/F)$ is not interesting.

\begin{example}
    Let $\aa$ be the real cube root of $2$, and let $E = \QQ(\aa)$. Then $[E:\QQ] = 3$ (since the minimal polynomial of $\aa$, which is $f(x) = x^3 - 2$, is irreducible over $\QQ$). Now suppose that $\sigma \in \Aut(E/Q)$. We've seen that $\sigma$ is entirely determined by $\sigma(\aa)$. But $E \subset \RR$, and $\sigma(\aa)$ has to satisfy $$\sigma(\aa)^3 = \sigma(\aa^3) = 2.$$
    In particular, $\sigma(\aa)$ is a real cube root of $2$, and so the only possibility is $\sigma(\aa) = \aa$. In other words, the only element of $\Aut(E/Q)$ is the trivial element $\sigma(x) = x$ for all $x \in E$.
\end{example}

This example is somewhat unsatisfying. One of the important properties of the group $\Aut(\CC/\RR)$ is that the non-trivial element fixes exactly $\RR$. In the example above, the (trivial) group $\Aut(E/\QQ)$ isn't going to be of much use in studying the field $E$. In some sense, the problem is that $E$ contains only one cube root of 2, but we expect there to be 3 distinct cube roots of 2; we'll explore this more when we define what it means for an extension to be Galois.

\begin{example}
    We can show $\Aut(\RR/\QQ)$ is also trivial. Let $\sigma\in \Aut(\RR/\QQ)$. From the observation that $$\sigma(a^2)=\sigma(a)^2 > 0,$$ we see $\sigma$ must take positive to positive and hence order-preserving. And then it must be continuous (by more detailed arguments) but any continuous map on $\RR$ which is the identity on $\QQ$ is the identity map (again you may fill the details if you want).
\end{example}

\noindent Our next example says something about finite fields. We do a quick catch-up here.


We denote the finite field of order $p$, where $p$ is a prime, by $\FF_p=\{0,1,\cdots,p-1\}$. If $F$ be a finite field with $q$ elements and suppose that $F \subset K$ where $K$ is also a finite field. Then $K$ has $q^n$ elements where $n = [K:F]$ from the knowledge on finite field extensions. Hence a finite field is isomorphic to $\FF_{p^n}$ where $p$ is its characteristic and $n\in \NN$ --- we will show any two fields have the same number of elements are isomorphic.

Since $\FF_{p^n}^\times$ is cyclic of order $p^n-1$, we have $a^{p^n} = a$ for all $a\in \FF_{p^n}$. The polynomial $x^{p^n}-x$ has at most $\deg =  p^n$ roots and we conclude $$x^{p^n}-x = \prod_{a\in \FF_{p^n}} (x-a) \in \FF_{p^n}[x].$$ As we will see later, $\FF_{p^n}$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n}-x\in \FF[x].$

\begin{example}
    Let $p$ be a prime, and consider the extension $\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p$. We define a function $\sigma: \FF_{p^n} \to \FF_{p^n}$ by $\sigma(x) = x^p$. By the binomial theorem, and the fact that p divides the binomial coefficient $\binom{p}{j}$for any $1 \leq j \leq p-1$, we have $$\sigma(x + y) = (x + y)^p = x^p + y^p + p\cdot \mbox{(something)} = \sigma(x) + \sigma(y).$$
    And of course $\sigma(xy) = \sigma(x)\sigma(y)$. So $\sigma$ is a homomorphism. We wish to show that $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\FF_{p^n}$. Since $\FF_{p^n}$ is finite, we simply need to show that $\sigma$ is either surjective or injective. We'll show that it's injective. To see this, suppose to the contrary that there's some non-zero $x \in \FF_{p^n}$ with $\sigma(x) = 0$. Since the group of non-zero elements $\FF_{p^n}$ is cyclic, say, generated by $\gamma$. If $x =\gamma^j$, then $$x^{p^n} = (\gamma^j)^{p^n} = (\gamma^{p^n})^j = \gamma^j = x.$$
    On the other hand,  $$x^{p^n}= \sigma^{(n)}(x) = \sigma^{n-1}(\sigma(x)) = \sigma^{(n-1)}(0) = 0,$$ where $\sigma^{(n)}$ means compose $\sigma$ with itself $n$ times. We reach a contradiction.
    Also, note that $\sigma$ fixes $\FF_p$, so really $\sigma \in \Aut(\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p)$. It's possible to show that $\sigma$ generates this group (laster).

\section{Separable extensions}
Let $f(x)\in F[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial and $(E=F[\aa],\aa)$ its stem field (or $E$ a field containing all the roots). From what we have learnt from last week, we know an element in $\Aut(E/F)$ shall permute the roots of $f$. It then follows not surprisingly that we want the distinctness of the roots; in other words, we want the roots are separable.

\begin{defn}
    Let $k$ be a field. A nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in k[x]$ is called \emph{separable} if it has no repeated roots (in any extension field). 
\end{defn}

Recall that the derivative of a polynomial $f(x)=\sum a_i x^i$ is defined to be $f'(x) = \sum ia_ix^{i-1}$. When $f$ has coefficients in $\RR$, this agrees with the definition in calculus. The usual rules for differentiating sums and products still hold, but note that in characteristic $p$ the derivative of $x^p$ is zero.

\begin{thm}\label{sep}
    Let $K$ be a field. An irreducible $f$ polynomial in $K[X]$ is separable if and only if $\gcd(f,f')=1$ in $K[X]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f(X)$ be an irreducible polynomial in $K[X]$. Suppose $f(X)$ is separable, and let $\aa$ be a root of $f(X)$ (in some extension of $K$. Then $f(X) = (X -\aa)h(X)$ for some $h(x)\not=0$. Since $f'(\aa)=h(\aa)\not=0$, $f'$ is non-zero and $\deg(f')<\deg(f)$. It follows from the irreducibility of $f$ immediately that $\gcd(f,f')=1$.

    Now suppose $f(X)$ is not separable and $\aa$ is a repeated root (in an extension field). Then we can write $f(X)=(X-\aa)^2g(X)$ (in some extension field), where $g(x)$ is non-zero, and then  $f'(X)= (X-\aa)^2g'(X)+2(X-\aa)g(x)$. It follows that $f'$ is non-zero as well and $f'(\aa)=0$. By Theorem \ref{minimal}, both $f,f'$ are divisible by the minimal polynomial of $\aa$ in $K[X]$ and then $\gcd(f,f')\not=1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    A field $F$ is said to be \emph{perfect} if every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ is separable.
\end{defn}

Fortunately, almost all the fields we have good feelings at are perfect. 

\begin{thm}
    A field $F$ is perfect if and only if either $F$ has characteristic $0$, or $F$ has characteristic $p$ and the function $\sigma(x): F\to F, x\mapsto X$ is an isomorphism. (And then in particular, any finite field is perfect.)
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $F$ has characteristic 0. Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial. Then $\deg(f')=\deg(f)-1\not=0$ and it follows from the irreducibility of $f$ that $\gcd(f,f')=1$. Therefore, $f$ is separable by Theorem \ref{sep}.  

    Now consider the case when the characteristic of $F$ is a prime $p$. We already see $\sigma$ is a field homomorphism last week. Since field homomorphisms are injective, we only need to consider the surjectivity  of $\sigma$.

    Suppose that $\sigma$ is not surjective and $a\in F$ is not in the image. Then the polynomial $f(x)=x^p-a$ has no roots in $F$. 
    
    Claim: $f(x)$ is irreducible.

    Proof of claim: By Theorem \ref{stem}, let $E/F$ be a finite extension containing a root $\bb$ of $f$ and so that $$f(x)=x^p-a=x^p-\bb^p=(x-\bb)^p \in E[x].$$
    Thus if $f$ factors non-trivially in $F[x]$, then a factor of $f$ looks like $(x-\bb)^j \in F[x]$ for some $1\leq j<p$. The coefficient of $x^{j-1}$ in $(x-\bb)^j$ is $-j\bb$. Since $j\not=0$ in $F$, we conclude $\bb$ lies in $F$ and reach a contradiction. 

    Notice that $f'(x)=px^{p-1} = 0$ in $F[x]$. So every root of $f$ is a multiple root. We have shown $f$ is irreducible and inseparable and then $F$ is not perfect.
    
    For another direction, suppose that $\sigma$ is surjective and that $f\in F[x]$ is irreducible and inseparable. Similarly to the argument in Theorem \ref{sep}, we get $f$ divides $f'$. If $f'$ was not the zero polynomial, then $\deg(f')< \deg(f)$, which is impossible given $f\mid f'$. Let $f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ then we get $$0=f'(x)=\sum_{i=1}^dia_ix^{i-1}\in F[x].$$  Therefore, $ia_i=0$ for each $i$, which says $a_i=0$ or $i=0$ in $F$. In other words, $a_i=0$ unless $p|i$ and then we can write $$f(x)= \sum_{i=0}^m a_{ip}x^{ip}.$$ But $\sigma$ is surjective, then $a_ip =  (\aa^i)^p$ for some $\aa_i\in F$ for each $i$ and $$f(x) =  \sum_{i=0}^m (\aa_i)^p x^{ip} = (\sum_{i=1}^m \aa_ix^i)^p.$$ This polynomial is definitely reducible and we reach a contradiction.
\end{proof}


This theorem says that fields of characteristic 0 and finite fields are perfect. There is actually a  more elementary proof when $F=\FF_p$.

\begin{thm}
    Let $f(x)\in \FF_p[X]$ be irreducible and of degree $n$. Then $f$ is irreducibility and $f$ divides $X^{p^n}-X$. (Hence or otherwise, $X^{p^n} -X$ has a factorization $X^{p^n}-X =  \prod_{d\mid n}\prod_{f_d} f_d$, where $f_d$ runs over all irreducible polynomials of degree $d$.)
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
    Assume $f(X)\not= X$ and the image of $X$ is $x\in \FF_p[X]/(f) = E$. Then $[E:\FF_p] =  n$ and $|E|=p^n$. We then know $E^\times$ is cyclic of order $p^n-1$ and then $x^{p^n-1} = 1$ and $x^{p^n} = x$. So $X^{p^n}-X$ has a root $x$ and then $f\mid X^{p^n}-X$ by Theorem \ref{minimal}. Moreover, $X^{p^n}-X$ has no repeated roots --- its has at most $p^n$ roots and they are all of $E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    Let $E/F$ be an algebraic extension of fields, and let $\aa \in E$ be algebraic over $F$. We say that $\aa$ is \emph{separable} over $F$ if the minimal polynomial of $\aa$ over $F$ is separable. We say that $E/F$ is \emph{separable} if every element of $E$ is separable over $F$.
\end{defn}
